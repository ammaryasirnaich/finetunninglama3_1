# Fine-Tuning Meta-Llama-3.1-8B parameter Language Model with 2.1x faster performance and taking 60% less memory using unsloth

## Highlights

This tutorial will guide you through the process of fine-tuning the latest Meta-Llama-3.1-8B language model released by Meta using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). Key features include:


### Basic Steps

1. **Setting Up the Environment**:
   - Installation of necessary libraries including `torch`, `transformers`, `datasets`, `trl`, and `unsloth`.

2. **Configuration**:
   - Setting parameters such as maximum sequence length, data type, and precision options.

3. **Model and Tokenizer Loading**:
   - Loading a pre-trained model and tokenizer using `FastLanguageModel`.

4. **Data Preparation**:
   - Formatting data with a pre-defined prompt structure (`alpaca_prompt`) and loading datasets using `datasets` library.

5. **Training**:
   - Configuring and running the training process with `SFTTrainer`, including hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and training steps.

6. **Model Saving**:
   - Saving the trained model and tokenizer locally and optionally pushing to Hugging Face Hub.

### Advanced Steps

1. **Using LoRA**:
   - Implementing Low-Rank Adaptation for efficient fine-tuning of large models by specifying low-rank configurations.

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Monitoring GPU memory usage before and after training to manage large model requirements.

### Challenging Datasets

Suggested datasets for advanced fine-tuning include:
- **Common Crawl**: For a diverse range of web data.
- **Wikitext-103**: For structured and factual information.
- **BooksCorpus**: For long-form content and narratives.
- **CodeSearchNet**: For programming and code-related tasks.

## Conclusion

This tutorial covers both the basics and advanced configurations necessary for effectively fine-tuning language models. By experimenting with different datasets and training parameters, users can achieve optimized and capable models.
